#  Digital Paper Edit - Server API

## Current status

The client and API was initially developed to be portable to any platform - i.e local, web, cloud provider, and Electron.
We are currently developing and maintaining a **[firebase version](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-firebase)** that merged the functionalities of the [client](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-client/) and [API](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-api/). The BBC is **not actively working on digital-paper-edit-client and digital-paper-edit-api**. This is because we are prioritising getting Digital Paper Edit in front of our journalists. For the full list of active/inactive DPE repos, see [here](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-client/#active).

A fork of the client and API is still being developed in the open, in a **[separate fork](https://github.com/pietrop/digital-paper-edit-api)**, thanks to @pietrop. 

We don't want the opensource collaboration to stop, so we will be pulling in changes from the forks. If there's a valuable feature that we haven't yet implemented from the fork, please open an issue in **[this repo](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-firebase)** or get in touch with us!

### Collaborating across forks

We will look at the changes in the [fork](https://github.com/pietrop/digital-paper-edit-api) and manually add them to our [firebase version](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-firebase).

When manually adding changes to the changes from a fork - there are challenges of pulling in dependencies, such as:

```javascript
[
  ("@bbc/aes31-adl-composer": "^1.0.1"),
  ("@bbc/digital-paper-edit-react-components": "^1.3.2"),
  ("@bbc/fcpx-xml-composer": "^1.0.0"),
  ("@bbc/react-transcript-editor": "^1.4.0")
];
```

These dependencies (non-exhaustive) they might've been forked also. In this case, this is a matter of updating the BBC's version with the newest changes from the dependency's forks and making sure everything works together.

For understanding the approach see [this PR](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-client/pull/94).
